- Think about the root generation when we use a cloud of points, which do not have a V_perf already prescribed
	- One option could be already generate the root segment
	- We will have a LV tree, RV tree and His-Bundle tree 


- Check the units

- Build classes for every struct
	- Class Cloud_Points should have a counter to the current point
