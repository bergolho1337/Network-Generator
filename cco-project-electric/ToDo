- Refactor the code until now

- Do more tests with the Minimize Activation Time Function with Level Penalty
	- Include Local Optimization

- Finish implement the following cost function libraries to work with local optimization:
	- Closest segment
	- Custom function
	- Minimize activation time

- Rewrite all the examples using the new features

- Think about how to deal with the circumscribed circle when generating the network.
	- Maybe create another function just to deal with this kind of geometry.
	- Pass as additional arguments the 'inner_radius' and 'outer_radius'.
