Priority:
- Refactor the code until now


- Implement the connection search from the paper (calculate d_threash)
- Use temporary ids to avoid calling the update_points() and update_segments() functions 
- Save the radius of each point as POINT_DATA on the VTK output file.
- Reescale the tree generate by the test1() function
    - First locate the index of the terminals than call the recursive function reescale using the parent pointer
    - Verify the correctness of teh function by calculating Murray's law in the end.
- Try to implement the structure using a linked list instead of a vector
- Implement the restore_state() function
